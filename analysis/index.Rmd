Welcome to my website, exploring the impact of interactions on complex traits in breeding programs.  
  
We use simulation to bridge the gap in scales between fundamental biological networks and breeding germplasm, in order to explore the impacts of both gene-gene, gene-trait and trait-trait interactions on complex traits.

I hope this resource provides some additional details on my work, and possibly some new knowledge along the way.
